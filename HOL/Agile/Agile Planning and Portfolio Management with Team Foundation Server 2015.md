1.  In this exercise, you will learn how to use Team Foundation Server
    2015 to manage your product backlog, create work items, break work
    items into tasks, assign tasks to team members, and track progress
    using the task board. This overview will demonstrate the basic
    project management tools that small- to medium-sized development
    teams can utilize for product development.



1.  **Note:** The team project used in this lab uses a Scrum process
    template, but the core features demonstrated apply to all
    process templates.

1.  Log in as **Julia Ilyiana** (VSALM\\Julia). All user passwords are
    **P2ssw0rd**.



1.  **Note:** In order to fully demonstrate the ALM features in this
    lab, we will first set the virtual machine to a specific date that
    lines up with a pre-configured, in-flight iteration. This lab needs
    to be walked through using the original virtual machine state
    (without any modifications made to source or work items), otherwise
    you will see errors.



1.  **Right-click** the **ConfigureALMDemo.bat** file on the Desktop and
    then select “**Run as administrator**”. This will set the date and
    time in the virtual machine to be a specific date that lines up with
    the demonstration data.

2.  Launch **Internet Explorer** from the taskbar and click **TFS FF
    Portal** from the favorites bar at the top.

1.  **Note:** There is also an option to create a **New team project**
    directly from the web site. In addition, users with the appropriate
    permissions can delete projects as well.

1.  This view shows that the Fabrikam Fiber collection has one project
    in it named **FabrikamFiber**. This project contains a few different
    teams, with the **Fabrikam Fiber Leadership Team** being set as the
    default team for the project. We will take a closer look at teams in
    a later exercise.



1.  **Note:** This lab refers to this default team as both the
    leadership team and the management team. They both refer to the
    same team.

1.  Navigating to a different team



1.  The **Home** view for the Fabrikam Fiber Web team provides a
    high-level overview of the current iteration (Sprint 3) including
    team workload versus capacity, burndown of tasks over time, and team
    favorites, which can include a configurable assortment of work item
    queries, build definitions, and version control paths. In addition,
    there are links to quickly create new work items and bugs, load the
    backlog, task board, initiate requests for feedback and so on.

1.  **Note:** Team favorites can be added or removed from within the
    web portal. For example, navigate to the Build tab to assign build
    definitions as a team favorite. In addition, team favorite work item
    queries can be modified from within Visual Studio.

    Each team can have different team favorites listed, different work
    capacity, and even different work items. The determining factor of
    where a work item will show up is governed by the **Area** field.



1.  As you can see under the **Team Members** section, there are several
    members listed in this team. Teams are a concept that were
    originally introduced in Team Foundation Server 2012 to make it
    easier to manage, assign, and track work.

1.  Locate the overall **Work** bar that shows how close to capacity we
    are for the current iteration based on the total of the Remaining
    Work for the tasks in this iteration and based on the total capacity
    for the team. It looks like we are okay now, but we still haven’t
    broken the new user story into tasks for the team yet.

1.  The capacity view allows us to specify the number of hours per day
    that each team member will be working on this project, days off per
    team member, and overall team days off. These capacity settings
    apply to the current iteration. You can optionally use the activity
    column to describe the disciplines that each team member
    specializes in. When tasks are broken down by activity as well, it
    can provide another view across your team’s capacity to determine
    if, for example, you have enough people working on documentation to
    meet the demands for this iteration. For now, leave the capacity
    settings unmodified.

    the new work item. Return to the **Iteration 3** backlog view. Click
    the button with the ‘**+**’ symbol in it to the left of the new user
    story to add a new task. This will become a child task of the user
    story and will be used to help describe the implementation details
    required to complete this user story.

####Task 4: Working with the Task Board

1.  Now that we have finished breaking down the work and assigning it to
    team members, let’s take a look at the task board that will be used
    in the next stand-up team meeting to report and record progress.
    Select the **Board** tab from Iteration 3.

    work within this virtual machine, but you might want to put in your
    request now for that nice wall-mounted touch-screen monitor you have
    been desiring for your team.

    **Note:** Team Foundation Server 2015 has introduced numerous
    enhancements to the cards shown for tasks and Kanban views including
    styling, use of avatars, and even responsive layout based on
    browser size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  In this exercise, you will learn about some of the agile portfolio
    management capabilities provided by Team Foundation Server. These
    capabilities allow larger organizations to understand the scope of
    work across several teams and see how that work rolls up into
    broader initiatives. In this exercise, you will explore how multiple
    teams at Fabrikam Fiber can collaborate together to work
    on features.

    teams, even for work items that are not mapped to features.
    Optionally, the management team could also choose to not include
    sub-areas, thereby removing work items from their product backlog
    view as soon as they are assigned to one of the teams.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  In the previous exercise, you learned about how Team Foundation
    Server can scale to meet the needs of larger teams working towards
    common goals. This approach requires that everybody in the
    organization uses the same team project within Team Foundation
    Server and therefore the same process template (which defines the
    way work items and their workflows are defined). Understanding this,
    Microsoft has begun to allow individual teams to customize certain
    aspects of the ways in which they manage and track their work
    without requiring centralized changes to their process templates.

    In this exercise, you will learn more about Kanban and how it
    contributes to the flexibility of the agile toolset. You will also
    learn about work item tagging. Both of these features can be
    utilized and customized independently by different teams, without
    making changes to the underlying process template.

#### <span id="_Toc429723516" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc451341237" class="anchor"></span></span>Task 1: Introduction to Kanban Tools

1.  The **Kanban** board was first introduced with Team Foundation
    Server 2012 Update 1. Kanban is a process improvement tool that can
    be used in an incremental fashion regardless of the current software
    development methodology that you are using. It assists with the
    throttling and tracking of work and illustrates the delivery of
    value over time to the project stakeholders. Each backlog has its
    own Kanban board, and each team has its own view of that.

    iterations allowing you to move items between states and allows you
    to set Work in Progress (WIP) limits for each state. One of the
    primary reasons for using Kanban and limiting work in progress is
    that it helps identify bottlenecks in your development process and
    minimize lead time for new features. Let’s say that the devices team
    is not delivering finished work as quickly as desired, and that it
    is suspected that the underlying issue may have to do with taking on
    too many tasks at once at the beginning of each sprint (and the
    associated context-switching tax). If we are more careful about the
    number of tasks that we commit to, perhaps we can better focus
    our efforts.

2.  Let’s lower the **Work in Progress** limit for the **Committed**
    state to see what the Kanban board looks like when too much work has
    been committed to at once. Right now, the limit is **5** work items.

1.  On the Kanban board, column headers will provide an indication when
    a Work in Progress limit is exceeded. In this case, the Committed
    column shows us that we have exceeded the limit.

1.  **Note:** Work in Progress limits provide feedback when appropriate
    but they do not prevent a team from taking on additional work. You
    need to actively check the Kanban board in order to discover that
    you are exceeding set limits.



1.  You can also configure the Kanban boards to show (or hide) bugs
    as desired. Click the gear icon in the top-right corner of the
    window to open the administration page in a new browser tab.

    <img src="./media/image85.png" width="324" height="140" />

2.  Navigate to the **Settings** tab for the **Fabrikam Fiber Devices
    Team** and scroll down to locate the **Bugs** section.

1.  Filtering on the Kanban board is another new feature of Team
    Foundation Server 2015. Click the **Search** button and then search
    for “**technician**”.

1.  Kanban board search filter



1.  



1.  **Clear** the search box.



1.  **Note:** The New column has an additional search filter box that
    only applies to work items in the New state, which is useful when
    you want to search for something from your backlog without losing
    context of other work items.



1.  Let’s say that the devices team has decided that they want to add in
    a column that represents work that has been tested on a
    physical device. This is the only team that would desire to keep
    track of such a state, and they can easily add this to their
    Kanban board.

2.  Click the **Configure settings** button. Here you can add, remove,
    delete, and even rename columns to better suit your team workflow.
    However, you are still subject to restrictions put in place by the
    underlying process template, so you must map columns to valid work
    item states and respect the valid state transitions.

    <img src="./media/image92.png" width="287" height="166" />

3.  Navigate to the **Columns** tab and click the **+ Column** button.
    Reorder the new column to be next to **Done** and set its **Name**
    to “Device Tested”.

1.  You can also modify what your team considers to be the meaning of
    the Definition of Done for each Kanban column. This will help teams
    to stay on the same page even when a work item should be moved to
    the next state. Scroll down to the bottom of the form and define the
    definition of “done” for this column using plain text or Markdown.
    Provide a message such as “**Has been tested on Android, Windows
    Phone, and iPhone**” and then click **Save and close**.

    <img src="./media/image94.png" width="648" height="377" />

2.  You new column is now live on your board, and you can click the
    helper icon to see the **Definition of Done**.

1.  The Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD) shows the amount of work in
    various states over time for the selected team. The horizontal axis
    shows lead time and the vertical axis shows work in progress.

1.  **Note:** The CFD shown above does not necessarily represent an
    ideal scenario where a team is providing continuous output. More
    typically and ideally, you would see bands of color representing all
    states increase over time like the following diagram.

    <img src="./media/image98.png" width="570" height="411" />



1.  Press the **Escape** key to close the CFD.

2.  The Kanban board has a ton of great and convenient configurability
    options designed to adapt to the way your team works. Reopen to the
    **Configure settings** dialog used earlier.

    <img src="./media/image92.png" width="287" height="85" />

3.  Navigate to the **Fields** tab. Here you can configure each work
    item type to show ID number, Assigned to field, Effort, Tags, or
    other fields that you wish to show. These options are configured per
    team, giving each team the flexibility it needs to manage its
    own workflow. Select the options to **Show ID** and **Show empty
    fields**.

1.  Switch to the **Bug** tab and check the same boxes here as well.
    Click **Save and close** to confirm.

    <img src="./media/image100.png" width="589" height="342" />

2.  Now each work item displays its ID, which is very useful if your
    team uses these in discussions or in references from code
    or documentation.

    <img src="./media/image101.png" width="354" height="315" />

3.  In addition, the empty fields are now “shown” in the card, which
    allows you to initialize them inline. Locate the item created
    earlier and assign it to **Adam Barr**.

    <img src="./media/image102.png" width="234" height="360" />

4.  The concept of swim lanes is also new in 2015. These horizontal
    lanes can be added to Kanban boards to further categorize work, with
    a common use of this to create an “expedite” lane for high-priority
    work that needs to skip through the normal workflow. Reopen the
    **Configure settings** dialog used earlier.

    <img src="./media/image92.png" width="287" height="85" />

5.  Kanban boards only have a single swimlane by default, you can add in
    as many lanes as you want. For example, you can use them to
    categorize items by severity (expedite, normal), departments, tiers,
    and so on. Navigate to the **Swimlanes** tab and add a new swimlane
    named “**Expedite**”.

1.  In addition to the customization of board behavior, the cards
    themselves can be easily styled. Click the **Configure settings**
    icon button to open the configuration dialog.

    <img src="./media/image106.png" width="272" height="118" />

2.  Select the **Styles** tab and click **Styling rule**. Set the
    **Name** to **“High severity”**. This rule will change the style of
    the cards for bugs with high severity in order to make them easier
    to identify.

    <img src="./media/image107.png" width="518" height="227" />

3.  Scroll down to change the **Card color** to a strong red and set the
    first clause to **“Severity = 1 – Critical”**. Note that you’ll need
    to manually enter the field name of **“Severity”**.

    <img src="./media/image108.png" width="509" height="295" />

4.  Select the **Tag colors** tab and set a tag coloring rule to easily
    identify all cards tagged with **“Windows Phone”**. Click **Save and
    close** to continue.

    <img src="./media/image109.png" width="505" height="294" />

5.  On the board, you can now see that backlog item tags for **“Windows
    Phone”** are colored yellow and are easy to identify.

    <img src="./media/image110.png" width="502" height="225" />

6.  Locate the bug created earlier and click the ellipses button and
    select **Open**.

    critical severity.

#### Task 2: Kanban prioritization

1.  As cards are reordered within a column on the Kanban board, their
    > relative priorities are adjusted in the backlog. Select the
    > **Backlog** tab and notice that the “Technician can see service
    > tickets…” work item is prioritized above “Technician can
    > report busy/late…”.

    <img src="./media/image114.png" width="571" height="258" />

2.  Return to the **Board** tab. Locate item \#216 and drag it
    > above \#211.

    <img src="./media/image115.png" width="330" height="267" />



1.  With the cards now reordered on the board, return to the **Backlog**
    tab and notice that the work items have been appropriately
    reprioritized to reflect their order on the board. Also note that
    “Customer should see weather-related outages…” has the highest
    priority in the backlog.

    <img src="./media/image116.png" width="558" height="269" />

2.  Return to the **Board**. Drag—but do not drop—the “Customer should
    see weather-related outages…” card from the **Approved** column over
    the **Committed** column. Note that as you move it vertically, the
    existing cards in the column move to allow you to drop it anywhere.
    Return to drop the card over its original **Approved** column so
    that no changes are made.

    <img src="./media/image117.png" width="294" height="211" />

3.  While this may be desirable to some teams, there are other teams
    that would prefer backlog item prioritization to be enforced as
    cards are moved between columns. After it, it can be difficult to
    understand where a card is currently prioritized as you graduate it
    from stage to stage. Click the **Configure settings** icon button to
    open the configuration dialog.

    <img src="./media/image106.png" width="272" height="118" />

4.  Select the **Card reordering** tab and select the second option.
    This will enforce that cards are placed in the appropriate place in
    a given column based on their relative priority in the backlog. Note
    that both options have sample animations to illustrate
    each behavior. Click **Save and close**.

    <img src="./media/image118.png" width="573" height="332" />

5.  Once again, drag the card from the **Approved** column over the
    **Committed** column. Note that this time, the cards in the target
    column don’t budge. Go ahead and drop it anywhere over the
    **Committed** column and note that it automatically flows to the top
    since it has the highest priority of the items in that column.

    <img src="./media/image117.png" width="302" height="217" />

6.  It’s important to note that while this setting controls the behavior
    of card reordering when a card it moved between columns, you can
    still easily reorder cards within a given column. For additional
    information on using the Kanban board, please see “[Kanban
    basics](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/kanban/kanban-basics)”.
